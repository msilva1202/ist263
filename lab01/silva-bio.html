    </head>

    <body>
        My name is Max Silva; Iâ€™m currently a senior at Syracuse University studying data analytics. Throughout my college years I have earned certification in excel as well as proficiency in coding programs such as SQL, python, java script, and R-code. Outside the classroom, I am a big sports fan. I follow both football and basketball religiously. I am also a big movie buff with a few of my favorites being gone girl, inglorious bastards, and gladiator.
