    <h1>The Movies of Quentin Tarantino</h1>
    <div class="films"><div class="resevoir">
    <h2>Resevoir Dogs (1992)</h2>

    <p>Tarantino’s first film is a stripped-down crime thriller about a diamond heist that falls apart before it
        even begins. The surviving crew members hole up in a warehouse, bleeding, panicked, and increasingly
        suspicious of each other. What follows is a tense game of loyalty and betrayal, with sharp dialogue and
        sudden bursts of violence that introduced Tarantino’s trademark style.</p>

    <h2>Pulp Fiction (1994)</h2>

    <p>A cultural landmark of the ’90s, Pulp Fiction weaves together the lives of gangsters, a boxer, a crime
        boss’s wife, and a pair of small-time thieves. The movie’s nonlinear storytelling keeps the audience on
        edge while its mix of dark humor, casual conversations, and shocking moments redefined what a crime film
        could be. It’s packed with iconic scenes that made Tarantino a household name.</p>

    <h2>Jackie Brown (1997)</h2>

    <p>Based on Elmore Leonard’s novel Rum Punch, this film follows Jackie Brown, a flight attendant caught
        smuggling money for a gun runner. With law enforcement closing in and her employer tightening the screws,
        she carefully plays both sides in a dangerous double-cross. More patient and character-driven than
        Tarantino’s earlier work, it’s a mature, soulful story about survival, trust, and second chances.</p>

    <h2>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003)</h2>

    <p>The Bride, a former assassin left for dead by her former team, wakes from a four-year coma and sets out on
        a bloody path of revenge. The first volume is a whirlwind of stylized violence, samurai duels, and martial
        arts showdowns that pull heavily from Japanese cinema and anime. It’s fast, brutal, and visually daring,
        stablishing one of Tarantino’s most iconic characters.</p>

    </div><div class="kb2">
    <h2>Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004)</h2>

    <p>While the first installment leaned heavily on action, the second part slows down to explore The Bride’s
        backstory and emotional journey. Her quest for vengeance continues, but this time with more dialogue,
        western-inspired showdowns, and a closer look at her complicated relationship with Bill. The film balances
        quieter moments with tense confrontations, bringing the saga to a dramatic, emotional conclusion.</p>

    <h2>Death Proof (2007)</h2>

    <p>As part of the double-feature Grindhouse project with Robert Rodriguez, Death Proof is Tarantino’s homage
        to ’70s exploitation cinema. It follows a stuntman who uses his modified “death proof” car to terrorize
        women on the road. But when he targets the wrong group, the tables turn in spectacular fashion. Full of
        long conversations, sudden violence, and adrenaline-fueled car chases, it’s both a tribute and a twist on
        the grindhouse formula.</p>

    </div><div class="inglourious">
    <h2>Inglourious Basterds (2009)</h2>

    <p>Tarantino reimagines World War II in this audacious, violent, and often funny revenge fantasy. A squad of
        Jewish American soldiers spreads fear through Nazi-occupied France by brutally killing and scalping
        soldiers, while a young cinema owner plans her own act of defiance against the regime. The two plots
        collide in a tense, explosive finale that rewrites history. The film’s mix of suspenseful dialogue and
        shocking action is classic Tarantino.</p>

    <h2>Django Unchained (2012)</h2>

    <p>Set in the pre–Civil War South, Django Unchained tells the story of a freed slave who partners with a
        German bounty hunter to take down criminals and ultimately rescue his wife from a cruel plantation owner.
        Equal parts western, revenge tale, and social commentary, the movie combines humor, sharp dialogue, and
        unflinching violence. It’s Tarantino’s bold take on America’s darkest history, wrapped in a spaghetti
        western style.</p>

    </div><div class="hateful">
    <h2>The Hateful Eight (2015)</h2>

    <p>In the aftermath of the Civil War, a snowstorm forces eight strangers into a Wyoming cabin: bounty hunters,
        criminals, and drifters, all with secrets to hide. Tension builds as lies are uncovered, alliances form
        and break, and the threat of violence looms over every conversation. With its claustrophobic setting,
        extended dialogue scenes, and sudden bursts of bloodshed, it plays like a stage play turned into a violent
        chamber piece.</p>

    </div><div class="once">
    <h2>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)</h2>

    <p>Set in 1969 Los Angeles, the film follows fading TV actor Rick Dalton and his stunt double Cliff Booth as
        they try to navigate a changing film industry. Their fictional story runs alongside real Hollywood history,
        including the rise of the Manson Family and the shifting culture of the era. Blending comedy, nostalgia,
        and shocking violence, Tarantino paints a love letter to the end of Hollywood’s golden age while
        offering a revisionist twist on one of its darkest moments.</p>
